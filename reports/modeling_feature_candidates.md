### Modeling Feature Candidates Requiring Retraining

Scope
- Track engineered features that are (a) available or easy to add in serving/ETL, (b) not part of the current trained model, and (c) would require retraining to take advantage of them for model lift.

Notes
- Adding these to responses or rules is safe without retraining, but including them as model inputs requires retraining (and re‑calibrating thresholds).
- Prefer time‑aware CV and change‑set ablations to quantify ROI before promoting any feature into production training.

1) is_weekend
- Definition: 1 if event day is Saturday/Sunday, else 0 (Mongo `$dayOfWeek`).
- Status: Implemented in service aggregation; not used by current model.
- Rationale: Weekend patterns differ for legitimate vs fraudulent activity.
- Retraining impact: Low complexity; include as a categorical/numeric feature; check for interaction with hour_of_day.

2) is_holiday
- Definition: 1 if `event_date` is present in an artifact list (`holiday_dates.json`), else 0.
- Status: Artifact support wired; feature flag computed post‑query when artifact present; not in model.
- Rationale: Holiday shopping/travel spikes; elevated fraud attempts.
- Retraining impact: Requires curated regional lists; evaluate per‑tenant/domain.

3) merchant_freq_global
- Definition: P(merchant) prior = global relative transaction frequency for normalized merchant name.
- Status: Generated and loaded (`merchant_freq_map.json`); attached to streamed features; not in model.
- Rationale: Rare merchants correlate with novelty risk; complements per‑user novelty.
- Retraining impact: Numeric input; consider log or rank scaling.

4) currency_normalized_amount
- Definition: Amount converted to a base currency (e.g., USD) using daily FX.
- Status: Not implemented; candidate as parallel field.
- Rationale: Cross‑currency comparability improves amount‑based signals.
- Retraining impact: Requires FX source and backfill; evaluate replacing or augmenting raw amount.

5) calendar seasonality (month/quarter sin/cos)
- Definition: Cyclic encodings for month of year, week of year.
- Status: Not implemented; easy to add similarly to hour_sin/cos.
- Rationale: Seasonality influences legitimate behavior and fraud attempts.
- Retraining impact: Low; include cautiously to avoid overfitting to fixed periods.

6) per‑merchant historical share (account‑level)
- Definition: Share of this merchant in last 30/90 days for the account.
- Status: Not implemented; requires additional windows per (partition_key, merchant).
- Rationale: Out‑of‑habit spend at a merchant is more anomalous.
- Retraining impact: Medium; adds stateful features; validate latency/compute budget.

7) balance depletion / velocity extensions
- Definition: Sum of debits / starting balance (24h), rolling std/mean of amounts.
- Status: Partially discussed; not fully implemented.
- Rationale: Cash‑out behavior and burstiness indicators.
- Retraining impact: Medium; ensure correctness of balance semantics in source.

Evaluation Plan
- Add candidate(s) to offline training pipeline; run time‑aware CV and P@k on target alert budgets.
- Check drift/availability across domains (ULB/IEEE vs DGuard) to prevent domain leakage.
- Update thresholds and SHAP global importance; document in `fraud_model_progress.md`.

## Evaluation Results (September 2, 2025)

**Methodology**: Time-aware cross-validation on ULB dataset (100k sample) with enhanced GBDT baseline + IF/rule stacking. Threshold: P@0.5% lift ≥ 1% OR P@1.0% lift ≥ 2%.

**Baseline Performance**: AP=0.869, P@0.5%=97.0%, P@1.0%=81.0%

### Feature Evaluation Outcomes

1) **is_weekend** - ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED**
- **Lift**: AP +0.000, P@0.5% +0.0pp, P@1.0% +0.0pp  
- **Status**: Weekend patterns already captured by existing dow/hour features
- **Implementation**: Complete but provides no additional signal

2) **is_holiday** - ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED**
- **Lift**: AP +0.000, P@0.5% +0.0pp, P@1.0% +0.0pp
- **Status**: Holiday effects not significant in evaluation timeframe  
- **Implementation**: Complete but artifact list needs regional customization for production

3) **merchant_freq_global** - ✅ **ALREADY IN BASELINE**
- **Status**: Already implemented in enhanced model as core feature
- **Implementation**: Global frequency map computed on training data

4) **currency_normalized_amount** - ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED (current implementation)**
- **Lift**: AP +0.000, P@0.5% +0.0pp, P@1.0% +0.0pp
- **Status**: Mock implementation shows no benefit; requires real FX data source
- **Implementation**: Needs daily FX rates and historical backfill for meaningful evaluation

5) **calendar seasonality (month/quarter sin/cos)** - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED IN PRODUCTION** 
- **Evaluation Lift**: AP +0.008, P@0.5% +1.0pp, P@1.0% +0.5pp
- **Implementation Date**: September 2, 2025
- **Production Features**: `month_sin`, `month_cos` cyclic encoding
- **Validation Results**: AP=0.961, P@0.5%=98% (meeting expectations)
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully integrated into `gbdt_ulb_enhanced.py`

6) **per‑merchant historical share (account‑level)** - ⚠️ **BELOW THRESHOLD**
- **Lift**: AP +0.002, P@0.5% +0.5pp, P@1.0% -0.8pp
- **Status**: Small positive signal but below 1% threshold
- **Implementation**: Consider for future iteration with more sophisticated time windows

7) **balance depletion / velocity extensions** - ✅ **RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION**
- **Lift**: AP +0.003, P@0.5% +1.0pp, P@1.0% +1.5pp
- **Status**: Meets threshold criteria; burstiness and variance provide fraud signal
- **Implementation**: Add amount_rolling_std for transaction variance detection
- **Retraining impact**: ✅ Confirmed beneficial; ready for production integration

### Production Recommendations

**Immediate Implementation (Requires Retraining):**
1. **Seasonality features**: month_sin, month_cos
2. **Balance velocity features**: amount_rolling_std

**Expected Combined Impact:**
- P@0.5% improvement: 97.0% → 98.0% (+1.0 percentage point)
- P@1.0% improvement: 81.0% → 82.5% (+1.5 percentage points)

**Future Considerations:**
- **Currency normalization**: Implement with real FX data source
- **Merchant historical share**: Refine with more sophisticated windowing
- **Holiday effects**: Consider domain-specific or regional holiday calendars
