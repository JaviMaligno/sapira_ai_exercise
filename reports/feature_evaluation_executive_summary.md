# Feature Candidate Evaluation - Executive Summary

**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Scope:** Comprehensive evaluation of 7 candidate features from `modeling_feature_candidates.md`  
**Objective:** Identify features that provide meaningful model performance improvement requiring retraining

---

## Key Findings

### ✅ Recommended for Production Implementation

**1. Calendar Seasonality Features**
- **Features**: `month_sin`, `month_cos` cyclic encoding
- **Performance Impact**: +1.0pp P@0.5% precision, +0.5pp P@1.0% precision, +0.008 AP
- **Business Value**: Captures seasonal fraud patterns beyond daily/hourly cycles
- **Implementation Effort**: Low complexity, no additional data sources required

**2. Balance Velocity Extensions** 
- **Features**: `amount_rolling_std` for transaction variance detection
- **Performance Impact**: +1.0pp P@0.5% precision, +1.5pp P@1.0% precision, +0.003 AP  
- **Business Value**: Detects transaction burstiness and cash-out behaviors
- **Implementation Effort**: Low complexity, extends existing velocity features

### ❌ Not Recommended

**3. Weekend/Holiday Indicators**
- **Features**: `is_weekend`, `is_holiday` binary flags
- **Result**: No measurable performance improvement
- **Reason**: Temporal patterns already captured by existing `dow`/`hour` features

**4. Currency Normalization** 
- **Features**: `currency_normalized_amount` FX-converted amounts
- **Result**: No improvement with mock implementation (all USD)
- **Reason**: Requires real FX data source; current baseline handles single-currency effectively

**5. Merchant Historical Share**
- **Features**: Per-merchant transaction frequency within account
- **Result**: Small positive signal (+0.5pp P@0.5%) but below 1% threshold
- **Reason**: Simple implementation insufficient; may benefit from sophisticated time-windowing

## Performance Impact Summary

| Metric | Baseline | With Recommended Features | Improvement |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **P@0.5%** | 97.0% | 98.0% | **+1.0pp** |
| **P@1.0%** | 81.0% | 82.5% | **+1.5pp** |
| **AP** | 0.869 | 0.872+ | **+0.003+** |

**Alert Budget Impact**: At 0.5% alert rate, precision improvement from 97% to 98% means 1 additional true fraud detected per 100 alerts.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (Recommended Features)
- [ ] Update feature engineering pipeline with seasonality features
- [ ] Add balance velocity statistics to enhanced model
- [ ] Retrain model with time-aware cross-validation 
- [ ] Recalibrate per-category thresholds
- [ ] Update serving artifacts and deployment configs
- [ ] Conduct shadow scoring validation

### Phase 2: Future Considerations
- Currency normalization with real FX data integration
- Enhanced merchant share features with sophisticated windowing  
- Domain-specific holiday calendars for international operations
- Advanced velocity metrics (transaction timing patterns)

## Technical Notes

**Evaluation Methodology**:
- Time-aware cross-validation with chronological splits (60%-80%, 80%-100%)
- Enhanced GBDT baseline with IF/rule stacking
- ULB Credit Card Fraud dataset (100k sample)
- Threshold criteria: P@0.5% lift ≥ 1% OR P@1.0% lift ≥ 2%

**Model Architecture**:
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier with isotonic calibration
- Stacked with Isolation Forest anomaly scores and rule-based features
- Per-category thresholds with global fallback
- Merchant frequency mapping on training data only

**Data Quality Considerations**:
- No data leakage; all features computed with point-in-time semantics
- Robust to missing values through median imputation
- Category-aware normalization prevents domain shift artifacts
- Time-aware splits prevent temporal leakage

---

## Business Impact

**Risk Mitigation**: 1 percentage point improvement in precision at 0.5% alert rate translates to catching more fraudulent transactions without increasing false positive burden on operations teams.

**Operational Efficiency**: Features require no additional data sources or complex infrastructure, making implementation straightforward with existing fraud scoring service.

**Model Robustness**: Seasonality features provide stability across different time periods, while velocity features adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

**Scalability**: Both feature types are computationally efficient and compatible with real-time scoring requirements.
