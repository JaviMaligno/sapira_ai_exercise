### Recommended options

- Option A (recommended): ECS Fargate + ALB + RDS (Postgres/Aurora) + S3
  - Matches your current Terraform. Production-ready, VPC‑isolated, scalable, least rework.
- Option B (simpler): AWS App Runner + RDS + S3
  - Faster to stand up, managed HTTPS, autoscaling built-in. Use a VPC connector to reach RDS. Fewer knobs than ECS/ALB; fine if you don’t need deep VPC/WAF control.
- Option C (not recommended unless you already run K8s): EKS or EC2 + Nginx
  - More ops overhead; only pick if you must standardize on EKS/EC2.

Below are concrete steps to complete Option A and what to change if you choose Option B.

### Finish Option A: ECS Fargate + ALB + RDS + S3 (using your Terraform)

1) Container image (ECR, not pip-install at runtime)

- Build a dedicated image that runs MLflow server. Push to ECR and reference it in the task definition instead of `python:3.11-slim` + `pip install` at runtime.
- Minimal Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir mlflow[extras]==2.18.0 boto3 psycopg2-binary gunicorn
EXPOSE 5000
# DB/Artifact vars come from env/secrets; add sslmode=require
CMD mlflow server \
  --backend-store-uri ${MLFLOW_BACKEND_STORE_URI} \
  --default-artifact-root ${MLFLOW_DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_ROOT} \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

- Set environment in task definition:
  - `MLFLOW_BACKEND_STORE_URI=postgresql://$DB_USER:$DB_PASSWORD@$DB_ENDPOINT:5432/$DB_NAME?sslmode=require`
  - `MLFLOW_DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_ROOT=s3://<your-bucket>/mlflow-artifacts`

2) S3 bucket for artifacts

- Use a single bucket name across local/prod (your local compose references `fraud-scoring-models-<accountid>/mlflow-artifacts`; terraform uses `fraud-models-test`). Pick one, e.g., `fraud-scoring-models-<accountid>` and:
  - Enable versioning, default SSE (SSE-S3 or KMS), block public access.
  - Update the ECS task IAM policy in `ecs.tf` to point to the chosen bucket and prefix.
- Add lifecycle policies if needed (e.g., transition old runs to IA/Glacier).

3) Database (RDS Postgres or Aurora Serverless v2)

- Your `rds.tf` is good starting point. For prod:
  - Consider Multi-AZ and bigger instance class, or Aurora Serverless v2 for auto-scaling.
  - Add a parameter group to enforce SSL and set `rds.force_ssl=1`.
  - Keep RDS private (no public access); only the ECS tasks’ SG can reach it.
  - Secrets Manager already provisions credentials; keep that and rotate periodically.

4) Networking and security

- VPC/subnets/NAT are already defined.
- ALB SG allows 80/443 from the world; ECS tasks SG allows 5000 from the ALB SG; RDS SG allows 5432 from ECS SG. Good pattern—keep it.
- Add WAF to the ALB for basic protections and IP allow-listing if needed.

5) HTTPS and auth for the MLflow UI

- Add an ACM certificate and an HTTPS listener on the ALB; redirect HTTP 80 to 443.
- Protect the UI (MLflow has no built-in auth):
  - Easiest: ALB OIDC auth with Amazon Cognito or your IdP. Add an authenticate action rule on the HTTPS listener before forwarding to the target group.
  - Alternative: oauth2-proxy behind ALB; more components to manage.
- Add a Route53 record (e.g., `mlflow.<your-domain>`) pointing to the ALB.

6) ECS service hardening and ops

- Replace the task `image` with your ECR image. Keep health checks and logs to CloudWatch (already configured).
- Add scalable target + policies (CPU/Memory) to autoscale desired_count.
- Set CloudWatch alarms (target 5xx, RDS CPU/storage/conn, ECS CPU/mem).
- Keep desired_count ≥ 2 for HA behind ALB.

7) Migrate existing tracking DB (if you want history)

- From your local Postgres container:
  - `pg_dump -Fc -h localhost -p 5433 -U mlflow_user mlflow_db > mlflow.dump`
- Restore to RDS:
  - `pg_restore -h <rds-endpoint> -U mlflow_user -d mlflow_db -v mlflow.dump`
- Ensure SSL is used for the restore (`sslmode=require`).

8) Terraform apply

- Add/adjust variables: region, project_name, bucket name, domain.
- Update these in Terraform:
  - `ecs.tf`: set `image` to your ECR URI and update S3 ARNs to your bucket.
  - `load_balancer.tf`: add ACM + HTTPS listener + 80→443 redirect; optionally WAF association.
  - `rds.tf`: consider Multi-AZ/Aurora and SSL parameter group.
- Then:
  - `terraform -chdir=aws-production/terraform init`
  - `terraform -chdir=aws-production/terraform plan -out tfplan`
  - `terraform -chdir=aws-production/terraform apply tfplan`
- Output gives ALB DNS; once DNS and ACM are in place, use your friendly domain.

9) Client-side config

- Point your code/tools to the new tracking server:
  - `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://mlflow.<your-domain>`
  - For writers, use IAM on ECS; for local writers, prefer token or SigV4 via reverse proxy if required.

### Minimal diffs you’ll make (high level)

- In `ecs.tf`:
  - Change `image` to ECR image.
  - Replace S3 ARNs (`fraud-models-test`) with your real bucket.
  - Change `command` to rely on `MLFLOW_*` envs; add `?sslmode=require` to the Postgres URI.
- In `load_balancer.tf`:
  - Add ACM cert and an HTTPS listener on 443; redirect 80→443.
  - Optionally add ALB OIDC authentication with Cognito.
- In `rds.tf`:
  - Consider Multi-AZ or Aurora Serverless v2.
  - Add parameter group to force SSL.

### If you prefer Option B: AWS App Runner

- Build and push the same ECR image.
- Create an App Runner service from ECR:
  - Configure env vars and connect a VPC connector to reach RDS in private subnets.
  - Use Secrets Manager for DB creds, map to env vars.
  - Set `MLFLOW_DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_ROOT` to S3 and task role to allow S3 access.
- App Runner gives managed HTTPS and autoscaling; add WAF and custom domain/ACM via App Runner features.
- Pros: simpler ops; Cons: fewer VPC/LB knobs and advanced routing compared to ALB, and some enterprise auth patterns are trickier than ALB OIDC.

### Quick checklist

- Single S3 bucket chosen and referenced consistently.
- ECR image built/pinned; ECS task uses it.
- RDS SSL enforced; connection uses `sslmode=require`.
- HTTPS via ACM; DNS set; optional WAF.
- UI auth via ALB OIDC/Cognito.
- Autoscaling, logs, alarms in place.
- Migration run (optional).

Status: I reviewed your Terraform and aligned the plan to complete the ECS/RDS/S3 setup you already have. If you want, I can draft the specific Terraform edits (ACM/HTTPS, OIDC auth, ECR image, bucket ARNs) or set up an App Runner variant.

I reviewed your Terraform in `aws-production/terraform` and your local MLflow compose. You already have a solid ECS Fargate + ALB + RDS + S3 scaffold; we just need to productionize it.

### Recommended options

- Option A (recommended): ECS Fargate + ALB + RDS + S3
  - Aligns with your existing Terraform. Best balance of control, security, HA, and cost.
- Option B (simpler): AWS App Runner + RDS + S3
  - Faster to stand up with managed HTTPS and autoscaling. Slightly fewer knobs than ECS/ALB.

### How to complete Option A (ECS Fargate + ALB + RDS + S3)

1) Build an MLflow image and push to ECR (avoid pip-installing at runtime)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir mlflow[extras]==2.18.0 boto3 psycopg2-binary
EXPOSE 5000
CMD mlflow server \
  --backend-store-uri ${MLFLOW_BACKEND_STORE_URI} \
  --default-artifact-root ${MLFLOW_DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_ROOT} \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

- Push to ECR and update `ecs.tf` task definition `image` to your ECR URI.

2) S3 artifacts bucket

- Pick one bucket and be consistent (e.g., `fraud-scoring-models-<account-id>` with prefix `mlflow-artifacts/`).
- Enable versioning and SSE, block public access.
- Update IAM in `ecs.tf` to use your bucket ARNs (not `fraud-models-test`).

3) RDS Postgres (or Aurora Serverless v2)

- Your `rds.tf` works; for prod, consider Multi-AZ or Aurora Serverless v2, and enforce SSL via a parameter group.
- Keep RDS private; only ECS tasks SG should reach it.

4) Secure networking and health checks

- Current SGs are good (ALB → ECS 5000; ECS → RDS 5432).
- Fix health checks: MLflow doesn’t serve `/health`. Use `/` for both ECS container and ALB target group paths.

5) HTTPS + domain + authentication

- Add ACM certificate and an HTTPS listener on ALB; redirect 80 → 443.
- Protect UI with ALB OIDC via Amazon Cognito (recommended) or put oauth2-proxy behind ALB.
- Add a Route53 record, e.g., `mlflow.<your-domain>` → ALB.

6) ECS service hardening and ops

- Keep desired_count ≥ 2 for HA.
- Add ECS autoscaling policies (CPU/Memory).
- Log to CloudWatch (already configured) and add CloudWatch alarms (5xx on ALB, ECS/RDS metrics).

7) Environment/secrets

- Set env vars in task definition:
  - `MLFLOW_BACKEND_STORE_URI=postgresql://$DB_USER:$DB_PASSWORD@$DB_ENDPOINT:5432/$DB_NAME?sslmode=require`
  - `MLFLOW_DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_ROOT=s3://<bucket>/mlflow-artifacts`
- Keep DB creds in Secrets Manager as you have; rotate periodically.

8) Optional: migrate existing MLflow runs

- `pg_dump -Fc` from local Postgres (port 5433 in your compose) and `pg_restore` to RDS with `sslmode=require`.

9) Apply infra

- `terraform -chdir=aws-production/terraform init && terraform -chdir=aws-production/terraform plan -out tfplan && terraform -chdir=aws-production/terraform apply tfplan`

### If you prefer Option B (App Runner)

- Use the same ECR image.
- Create App Runner from ECR; map env vars; attach a VPC connector to reach RDS subnets.
- Store DB creds in Secrets Manager; map as env vars.
- Set `MLFLOW_DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_ROOT` to your S3 bucket; allow S3 in App Runner instance role.
- Managed HTTPS and custom domain are built-in; attach WAF if needed.

### Small but important fixes to your current Terraform

- In `ecs.tf`:
  - Replace `image = "python:3.11-slim"` with your ECR image.
  - Replace the `command` block that installs MLflow with the simple `CMD` from the image and set `MLFLOW_*` envs instead.
  - Change container health check command to target `/` rather than `/health`.
  - Update S3 ARNs to the final artifacts bucket.
- In `load_balancer.tf`:
  - Update target group `health_check.path` to `/`.
  - Add HTTPS listener (ACM cert) and redirect 80 → 443.
  - Optionally add an authenticate action (Cognito OIDC) before forwarding.
- In `rds.tf`:
  - Add a parameter group to force SSL and consider Multi-AZ/Aurora.

If you want, I can draft the specific Terraform edits (ACM/HTTPS, OIDC, ECR image, S3 ARNs, health checks) once you share:

- Final S3 bucket name/prefix for MLflow artifacts
- Domain name and ACM certificate ARN (or the domain to request a cert)
- Whether you want Cognito-based auth for the UI
- Choice of RDS Postgres vs Aurora Serverless v2 and desired instance/scale settings
- Key outcomes:

  - Use ECS Fargate + ALB + RDS + S3 (best fit for your current code).
  - Build/pin an ECR image; don’t pip-install at runtime.
  - Enforce SSL to RDS; fix health checks to `/`.
  - Add HTTPS, domain, and OIDC auth on ALB.
  - Standardize artifacts bucket and IAM.
