We have been assigned an exercise. It can be found in png format in [data-science-exercise-1.png](mdc:data-science-exercise/data-science-exercise-1.png) and [data-science-exercise-2.png](mdc:data-science-exercise/data-science-exercise-2.png)
We already have a [draft.md](mdc:draft.md)
You will be asked to expand or rewrite certain parts, or to implement some code.
You may be asked to clarify some points. In that case, you should also make it more clear in the draft.
Every time you need to remember that we are working on the exercise to stay focus
We will code in python, for which you will be required to use virtual environments.
