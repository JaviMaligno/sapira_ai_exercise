# Keep Fraud Model Progress Updated

Whenever you make changes related to the fraud model (data profiling, feature engineering, rules, anomaly model, supervised models, thresholds, or evaluation):

- Update the progress log at [sapira_ai_exercise/reports/fraud_model_progress.md](mdc:sapira_ai_exercise/reports/fraud_model_progress.md)
  - Append the latest metrics block using outputs from:
    - [alerts_phase1_summary.json](mdc:sapira_ai_exercise/reports/phase1/alerts_phase1_summary.json)
    - [alerts_phase1.csv](mdc:sapira_ai_exercise/reports/phase1/alerts_phase1.csv)
  - Add an entry to the Decision log (date, change, rationale)
  - Adjust the Backlog/next steps if priorities change
- If you add new artifacts (models, notebooks, reports), link them in the "Artifact pointers" section
- Ensure any important caveats, data quirks, or anomalies are captured under "Notable findings"

This rule ensures our fraud model progress doc remains an accurate, living record through the MVP and Phase 2.
